# Contributing to AI Agent Development Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this experimental project! This repository explores the future of AI-driven software development.

## 🤖 Project Philosophy

**All code in this repository must be written by AI agents.** This is a core principle of the project. We're investigating how AI can autonomously develop, review, and improve software.

## 👥 How Humans Can Contribute

While AI agents write the code, humans play a crucial role:

### Ways to Contribute:

1. **Code Review**
   - Review pull requests created by AI agents
   - Provide feedback on code quality, structure, and best practices
   - Suggest improvements in issues

2. **Issue Creation**
   - Report bugs you find
   - Suggest new features or experiments
   - Propose improvements to the project

3. **Documentation**
   - Improve documentation clarity
   - Add examples and use cases
   - Help others understand the project

4. **Discussions**
   - Participate in GitHub Discussions
   - Share your experiences with AI coding tools
   - Discuss challenges and solutions

5. **Testing**
   - Test the code and report issues
   - Verify that AI-generated code works as expected

## 📨 Contribution Process

### For Code Contributions (via AI Agent):

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Have an AI agent create a new branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Let the AI agent write the code**
4. **Commit changes**: Use descriptive commit messages
5. **Push to your fork**
6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Clearly state that the code was written by an AI agent
   - Specify which AI tool was used (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
   - Describe what the code does and why

### For Non-Code Contributions:

1. **Create an Issue** for bugs or feature requests
2. **Start a Discussion** for ideas and questions
3. **Comment on Pull Requests** with reviews and feedback

## ✅ Pull Request Guidelines

All pull requests must:

- [ ] Be created by or on behalf of an AI agent
- [ ] Include a clear description of changes
- [ ] Specify which AI tool wrote the code
- [ ] Pass any existing tests
- [ ] Follow the project's code style
- [ ] Include appropriate documentation
