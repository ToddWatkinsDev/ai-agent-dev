# Contributing to AI-Agent Development Project

## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in the **ai-agent-dev** repository! This is an experimental project exploring AI-driven autonomous software development.

**Core Principle**: All code in this repository is written exclusively by AI agents. This is not negotiable - it's the foundation of the entire project.

---

## 🤖 The AI-Only Rule

**CRITICAL**: All source code must be written by AI agents exclusively.

- ✅ AI agents write the code
- ✅ Humans review and provide feedback
- ❌ NO human-written code
- ❌ NO manual code edits
- ❌ NO hand-coded patches

This ensures the repository remains a pure exploration of AI-driven development.

- Add usage examples
- Improve clarity and organization
- Create tutorials
- Document lessons learned

### 4. Project Ideation
- Propose new AI-written projects
- Define project scope and goals
- Specify success criteria
- Choose technologies and languages
- Let AI agents implement them

### 5. Testing & Validation
- Test edge cases
- Verify security practices
- Check performance metrics
- Report compatibility issues
- Validate against specifications

### 6. Community Discussion
- Participate in GitHub Discussions
- Share experiences with AI coding tools
- Discuss ethical AI development
- Exchange best practices
- Mentor new contributors
