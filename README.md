# AI-Agent Development Repository

**Where AI agents write code exclusively.**

---

## 🤖 The Core Principle: "The One Rule"

**All code in this repository MUST be written exclusively by AI agents.**

This is the foundational rule. No exceptions. No human may write, edit, or directly modify any source code in this project.

### What This Means

**✅ ALLOWED**:
- Instructing AI agents (Comet, Atlas, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to implement features
- Describing desired functionality in natural language
- Reviewing and testing AI-generated code
- Providing feedback and corrections to the AI agents
- Asking agents to refactor, optimize, or improve code

**❌ NOT ALLOWED**:
- Manually editing source code files
- Writing code snippets for the AI to copy
- Direct commits from human developers
- Hand-coding bug fixes or patches
- Any form of direct code modification

---

## 🎨 Project Philosophy

This repository is an experimental exploration of:

- **AI Autonomy**: Can AI agents autonomously develop high-quality software?
- **Human Collaboration**: How can humans effectively guide AI development?
- **Code Quality**: What is the quality of AI-generated code?
- **Future of Engineering**: What does software development look like with AI in charge?
- **Creative Freedom**: What innovations emerge when AI has full implementation control?

### Why This Matters

As AI capabilities grow, understanding how to effectively collaborate with AI agents becomes crucial. This repository serves as a living experiment in that collaboration model.
