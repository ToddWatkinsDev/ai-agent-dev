# AI-Agent Development Project

## 🤖 Project Rules

This repository follows a unique development methodology:

### The One Rule
**All code in this project MUST be written exclusively by AI agents.**

No human may write, edit, or directly modify any code. The only human interaction permitted is:
- Providing instructions to AI agents (such as Comet, Atlas, or similar)
- Reviewing and testing the output
- Giving feedback and new directions to the agents

### What This Means
- ✅ **Allowed**: Instructing an AI agent to implement features, fix bugs, refactor code
- ✅ **Allowed**: Describing desired functionality in natural language
- ✅ **Allowed**: Asking agents to review and improve existing code
- ❌ **Not Allowed**: Manually editing files in a text editor
- ❌ **Not Allowed**: Writing code snippets for the agent to copy
- ❌ **Not Allowed**: Direct commits from human developers

### Philosophy
This project explores:
- The capabilities and limitations of AI-assisted development
- How effectively AI agents can translate human intent into working code
- The evolution of human-AI collaboration in software engineering
- What happens when AI agents have full creative control over implementation

### Build Anything
There are no restrictions on **what** can be built - only **how** it's built. The project can evolve in any direction, implementing any features or technologies, as long as every line of code comes from an AI agent responding to human guidance.
